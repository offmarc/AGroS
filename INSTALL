MAKING IT WORK

The following software packages need to be installed on your system in order
to fully use this script:

1. GROMACS installation. The software GROMACS can be obtained from: 
   http://www.gromacs.org/Downloads
   The software needs to be compiled and installed on your system.
   Depending on what you want to do you can either use single or double 
   precision, although the latter will most likely cause much longer runtime. 
   A good instruction is found at:
   http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Installation_Instructions
   
   In order to run GROMACS efficiently you need the following additonal
   packages:
   - FFTW: http://www.fftw.org/
   - Some kind of MPI to run GROMACS in parallel - this is REALLY importan
     otherwise you will have to wait forever until you get reasonable results
     Your MPI command should either be MPIRUN or MPIEXEC. Otherwise you will 
     have to change the $call variable within the script.
   The parallel GROMACS mdrun binary should be called: mdrun_mpi
   Either add the GROMACS binaries to PATH or define it via the commandline:
   --gromacsPATH PATH
