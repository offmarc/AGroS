MAKING IT WORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGroS will use several other scripts deployed in this git repo. Currently, you
will either need to hardcode the path to the scripts or add them to the PATH 
environment variable, so they can be called without path.

The following software packages need to be installed on your system in order
to fully use this script:

1. GROMACS installation. The software GROMACS can be obtained from: 
   http://www.gromacs.org/Downloads
   The software needs to be compiled and installed on your system.
   Depending on what you want to do you can either use single or double 
   precision, although the latter will most likely cause much longer runtime. 
   A good instruction is found at:
   http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Installation_Instructions
   
   In order to run GROMACS efficiently you need the following additonal
   packages:
   - FFTW: http://www.fftw.org/
   - Some kind of MPI to run GROMACS in parallel - this is REALLY importan
     otherwise you will have to wait forever until you get reasonable results
     Your MPI command should either be MPIRUN or MPIEXEC. Otherwise you will 
     have to change the $call variable within the script.
   The parallel GROMACS mdrun binary should be called: mdrun_mpi
   Either add the GROMACS binaries to PATH or define it via the commandline:
   --gromacsPATH PATH

2. SCWRL installation. This part can be omitted, though doing so might result
   in missing sidechains. The software must be licensed and can be obtained 
   from: http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/scwrl4/
   SCWRL will be called using the following command: "scwrl".
   Again it either needs to be added to the PATH or be defined via commandline:
   --scwrlPATH PATH
   
3. If you want to fetch PDBs automatically from the PDB database, this will be
   done using the script fetchpdb. In order to function the command, which is
   normally installed on any linux system, "wget" needs to be installed. 
   The same applies to "gunzip" and the shell "bash" should be installed
   and used.
   
These are the commanline options:

USAGE:    AGroS <PDB FILE | PDB CODE> [<CHAIN: ...>] [OPTIONS]
OPTIONS:  [-dir PATH] 		directory to save results to
          [-threads int]  	number of processors to use (1)
          [-noscwrl]      	don't use scwrl
          [-v]                  verbose and a lot of text

          [-minSteps int]     	steps for minimisation (5000)
          [-lengthNVPT int]    	time for NVT & NPT in ps (50)
          [-lengthMD int]     	time for MD in ps (10.000)
          [-cutoffSTRW int]	cutoff in A for structural water to keep (15)

          [--gromacsPATH PATH] 	path to gromacs distribution
          [--scwrlPATH PATH]   	path to scwrl distribution

          [--jp] 	        just prepare structure for GROMACS


TESTING IT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A good test case is the PDB '1whz'. You can either use fetchpdb to pull the 
structure or just call AGroS with this identifier. If you want to run the 
simulation on two threads (CPUs) the call looks like this:

AGroS 1whz -threads 2

If you do not define a working DIR using "-dir PATH" the standard path will be 
chosen($HOME/projects/md). 

Finally, if you want to change more specific things such as solvent, boxes, 
thermostats, barostats or others, you will need to hack the scripts.

GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!
