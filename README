AGroS is a script package to allow easy setup and run of MD simulation using
GROMACS. The input is a pdb file or pdb identifier. Single or multiple chain
proteins are supported. Protein / DNA complexes are still in development. In 
the future we hope to support different pHs and special ligands.

To analyze the results  we will soon release  GroSA and SAGros, two packages 
to do stanadard analysis and then subsequently statistical analysis.
